- Web interface-specific:
 - Add more/better styles
 - Get the <textarea> contents to actually be monospaced
 - Strip the CRs from CRLFs in POSTed 'contents' fields?
 - Find & make URLs active when displaying notes
 - When listing large amounts of notes, break the list up into several pages
   (100 notes to a page?)
 - Redirect warnings to the browser?
 - Add fancy JavaScript stuff:
  - editing notes directly in the listings
  - auto-completion of tag names
  - collapsing the contents of a displayed note
 - Make the <title> change depending on what is being viewed
- Implement hierarchic to-do items
 - Add ways to manipulate the hierarchy to the web interface

- Add a way to assign individual notes rankings based on importance?
- Tags:
 - Handle tags case-insensitively
 - Add a way to retrieve all untagged items
 - Add a way to get the unions, intersections, and complements of sets of
   notes with given tags
 - Enforce a 32-character (or longer?) limit for tag names
 - Add a way to do batch operations like deleting or renaming all occurrences
   of a tag and replacing or augmenting all occurrences of a tag with one or
   more other tags
- Prevent characters like newlines & tabs from appearing in titles and tag
  names
- Test out the programs in util/
 - Make sure loadDB.pl handles Unicode input properly
- Create a curses-based interface to the database?
- Add an explicit license to the code
- Add a README file, including instructions on how to set the system up
