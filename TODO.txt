- Web interface-specific:
 - Add more/better styles
 - Get the <textarea> contents to actually be monospaced in Safari (It works in
   Firefox.)
 - Strip the CRs from CRLFs in POSTed 'contents' fields?
 - When listing large amounts of notes, break the list up into several pages
   (100 notes to a page?)
 - Redirect warnings to the browser?
 - Add fancy JavaScript stuff:
  - editing notes directly in the listings
  - auto-completion of tag names
  - collapsing the contents of a displayed note
 - Make the <title> change depending on what is being viewed
 - When editing a note, increase the number of lines in the <textarea> based on
   the number of lines in the note (though with some upper limit so as to avoid
   incredibly large <textarea>s)
 - Handle overly long URLs that (currently) have linebreaks inserted in them
   before being checked for URL-ness
- Implement hierarchic to-do items
 - Add ways to manipulate the hierarchy to the web interface
 - Make dumpDB.pl & loadDB.pl somehow preserve hierarchy information
 - Make createNote, updateNote, and deleteNote handle hierarchy information
   (deleteNote by detaching child notes)
- Give warnings for attempted deletion of nonexistent note IDs
- Improve the sorting of notes when retrieving by tag
- Add a way for the user to configure how notes are sorted
- Tags:
 - Handle tags case-insensitively
 - Add a way to retrieve all untagged items
 - Add a way to get the unions, intersections, and complements of sets of
   notes with given tags
 - Enforce a 32-character (or longer?) limit for tag names
 - Add a way to do batch operations like deleting or renaming all occurrences
   of a tag and replacing or augmenting all occurrences of a tag with one or
   more other tags
- Prevent characters like newlines & tabs from appearing in titles and tag
  names
- Test out the programs in util/
 - Make sure loadDB.pl handles Unicode input properly
- Create a curses-based interface to the database?
- Add an explicit license to the code
- Add a README file, including instructions on how to set the system up
- Add function documentation to NoteSys.pm
- Make the NoteSys.pm functions into methods of a database connection object?
