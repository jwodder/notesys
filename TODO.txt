Note hierarchies:
 - Make note listings display hierarchy information
  - The number of descendents (or just direct children?) should be displayed
    for all notes that have any.
  - Notes with parents should have links to them.
 - Add a user confirmation step to detaching notes
 - When viewing an individual note, add a link to its parent if it has one.
 - Make the truncation of long titles in the 'attach' page smarter (e.g., by
   splitting at word boundaries rather than always at 40 characters)
 - Make the confirmation pages for attaching & detaching notes refer to the
   notes involved by their (possibly truncated) titles rather than their ID
   numbers
 - Make the confirmation page for detaching notes refer to the former parent
 - Make the 'all' note listing show only top-level notes
 - Make note listings by tag only show the topmost notes with those tags
  - A note with the given tag that has $x descendents, of which $y also have
    the tag, should be labelled along the lines of "($y/$x descendents)"
 - The functions for attaching & detaching notes should update the 'edited'
   fields
 - Make dumpDB.pl & loadDB.pl preserve hierarchy information
 - Make createNote, updateNote, and deleteNote handle hierarchy information
   (deleteNote by detaching child notes)

Web interface:
 - Add more/better styles
 - Get the <textarea> contents to actually be monospaced in Safari (It works in
   Firefox.)
 - Strip the CRs from CRLFs in POSTed 'contents' fields?
 - When listing large amounts of notes, break the list up into several pages
   (100 notes to a page?)
 - Redirect warnings to the browser?
 - Add fancy JavaScript stuff:
  - editing notes (both text & tag lists) directly in the listings
  - auto-completion of tag names
  - collapsing the contents of a displayed note
  - Implement $autoback using JavaScript instead of a deprecated use of <meta>.
 - When editing a note, increase the number of lines in the <textarea> based on
   the number of lines in the note (though with some upper limit so as to avoid
   incredibly large <textarea>'s)
 - Replace the "note edited" and "note created" confirmation pages with
   redirects to the individual notes' pages
 - Make 'Back' links take you to ?mode=note queries and add 'Back' links to the
   bottom of the output from ?mode=note queries (both successful & failed)
  - Make 'Back' links somehow ignore notes accessed via the attachment preview
    button
 - Make it possible to specify notes to hide/not show by default?

NoteSys.pm internals:
 - Improve the sorting of notes when retrieving by tag
 - Make NoteSys.pm check whether the notes referenced in arguments to functions
   exist
 - Prevent control characters from appearing in titles, tag names, and note
   bodies
 - Trim trailing whitespace from note bodies
 - Make cleanLabel() handle non-ASCII characters properly
 - Make getAllNoteIDs and getTaggedNoteIDs (et alii?) take an optional argument
   specifying how to sort the entries
 - Make topLevelNotes() fetch notes in some deterministic order

Tags:
 - Handle tags case-insensitively
 - Add a way to retrieve all untagged items
 - Add a way to get the unions, intersections, and complements of sets of notes
   with given tags
 - Enforce a 32-character (or longer?) limit for tag names
 - Add a way to do batch operations like deleting or renaming all occurrences
   of a tag and replacing or augmenting all occurrences of a tag with one or
   more other tags

- Add a way for the user to configure how notes are sorted
- Make the dumping & loading programs export & import notes as JSON (instead of
  or in addition to the format currently used?)
- Add an explicit license to the code
- Add a README file, including instructions on how to set the system up
- Add function documentation to NoteSys.pm
- Make dumpDB.pl output notes in ascending ID order rather than descending
  creation order
- Advanced ideas:
 - Create a curses-based notesys interface
 - Make it possible to synchronize notesys databases across a network
 - Make the system multi-user
