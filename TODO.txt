- Synchronize the non-hierarchy-related changes between the branches
- Web interface-specific:
 - Add more/better styles
 - Get the <textarea> contents to actually be monospaced in Safari (It works in
   Firefox.)
 - Strip the CRs from CRLFs in POSTed 'contents' fields?
 - When listing large amounts of notes, break the list up into several pages
   (100 notes to a page?)
 - Redirect warnings to the browser?
 - Add fancy JavaScript stuff:
  - editing notes (both text & tag lists) directly in the listings
  - auto-completion of tag names
  - collapsing the contents of a displayed note
 - Make the <title> change depending on what is being viewed
 - When editing a note, increase the number of lines in the <textarea> based on
   the number of lines in the note (though with some upper limit so as to avoid
   incredibly large <textarea>'s)
 - Make the confirmation pages automatically redirect you to ?back after a
   certain amount of time
 - Make it possible to specify notes to hide/not show by default?
 - When viewing all notes with a given tag, the tag name in the list of tags
   should be made bold and not a link
 - Regexp::Common::URI doesn't match https links by default and matches gopher
   URLs poorly; there doesn't seem to be an easy way to correct this.  See:
   Regexp::Common::URI::{http,gopher}
 - When viewing all notes with a given tag, a list of all other tags used by
   those notes (and their frequencies among the set) should be shown somewhere.
 - Add "Edit" and "Delete" links at the bottoms of very long notes?
 - Make it possible to rename or delete all occurrences of a tag in one action
 - Add a search-like box for selecting tags (and intersections of sets of tags)
   without having to scroll through the list
 - Make the "Back" links make use of HTTP-Referrer whenever possible instead of
   cookies
 - Overly-long URLs should be displayed truncated with ellipses
 - Add support for Markdown-style hyperlinks, thus avoiding the need to display
   overly long URLs
- Implement hierarchic to-do items
 - Add ways to manipulate the hierarchy to the web interface
 - Make dumpDB.pl & loadDB.pl somehow preserve hierarchy information
 - Make createNote, updateNote, and deleteNote handle hierarchy information
   (deleteNote by detaching child notes)
- Give warnings for attempted deletions of nonexistent note IDs
- Improve the sorting of notes when retrieving by tag
- Add a way for the user to configure how notes are sorted
- Tags:
 - Handle tags case-insensitively
 - Add a way to retrieve all untagged items
 - Add a way to get the unions, intersections, and complements of sets of notes
   with given tags
 - Enforce a 32-character (or longer?) limit for tag names
 - Add a way to do batch operations like deleting or renaming all occurrences
   of a tag and replacing or augmenting all occurrences of a tag with one or
   more other tags
- Test out the programs in util/
 - Make sure loadDB.pl handles Unicode input properly
- Add an explicit license to the code
- Add a README file, including instructions on how to set the system up
- Add function documentation to NoteSys.pm
- Make the NoteSys.pm functions into methods of a database connection object?
- Make NoteSys.pm check whether the notes referenced in arguments to functions
  exist
- Advanced ideas:
 - Create a curses-based notesys interface
 - Make it possible to synchronize notesys databases across a network
 - Make the system multi-user
- Prevent control characters from appearing in titles, tag names, and note
  bodies
- Trim trailing whitespace from note bodies
- Make cleanLabel() handle non-ASCII characters properly
- Make the dumping & loading programs export & import notes as JSON (instead of
  or in addition to the format currently used?)
- It would probably be a good idea for Note objects to only store created &
  edited times as seconds since the epoch and leave the formatting up to the
  program actually doing the displaying
