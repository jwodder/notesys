NOTES ABOUT NOTESYS
To do:
 - Web interface:
  - Add more/better styles
  - Get the <textarea> contents to actually be monospaced
  - Strip the CRs from CRLFs in POSTed 'contents' fields?
  - Find & make URLs active when displaying notes
  - When listing large amounts of notes, break the list up into several pages
    (100 notes to a page?)
  - Redirect warnings to the browser?
  - After creating, deleting, or editing a note, have the counts at the top of
    the confirmation page reflect the change
  - Add fancy JavaScript stuff:
   - editing notes directly in the listings
   - auto-completion of tag names
   - collapsing the contents of a displayed note
  - Make the <title> change depending on what is being viewed
 - Implement hierarchic to-do items
  - Add ways to manipulate the hierarchy to the web interface
  - Make dumpDB.pl & loadDB.pl somehow preserve hierarchy information
  - Make createNote, updateNote, and deleteNote handle hierarchy information
    (deleteNote by detaching child notes)
 - Improve the error handling
  - Handle (in notes.cgi) the nonexistence of a requested note
  - Handle having no notes to display (either from selecting a nonexistent tag
    or from viewing an empty database)
 - Improve the sorting of notes when retrieving by tag
 - Add a way for the user to configure how notes are sorted
 - Add a way to assign individual notes rankings based on importance?
 - Tags:
  - Handle tags case-insensitively
  - Add a way to retrieve all untagged items
  - Add a way to get the unions, intersections, and complements of sets of
    notes with given tags
  - Enforce a 32-character (or longer?) limit for tag names
  - Add a way to do batch operations like deleting or renaming all occurrences
    of a tag and replacing or augmenting all occurrences of a tag with one or
    more other tags
 - Upload this project to Github?  (If I do so, the code should have an
   explicit license attached to it, probably the GNU Affero GPL.)
 - Prevent characters like newlines & tabs from appearing in titles and tag
   names
 - Test out the programs in util/
 - Make loadDB.pl handle Unicode input properly?
 - Create a curses-based interface to the database?
 - Handle invalid note IDs in mode=edit and mode=del queries

SQLite3 database contents:
 - See createDB() in NoteSys.pm for the actual complete definitions
