NOTES ABOUT NOTESYS
To do:
 - Finish translating notes.cgi from PHP to Perl (or just completely scrap it
   and start over)
 - Deal with HTML-encoding & quote-escaping of text in forms
 - Add styles to everything
  - Get the TEXTAREA contents to actually be monospaced?
 - Enforce a 32-character (or longer?) limit for tag names
 - Process POSTed tag names case-insensitively
 - Add a "reset" button to the "edit item" page
 - Implement hierarchic to-do items
 - Create a special tag for tagless items?
 - Add a way to automatically create & set up a new notes database
 - Get rid of the system of storing tags by IDs and just store the strings in
   'taggings'
 - Add a confirmation page before deleting a note
 - Improve the error handling?
 - Find & make URLs active when displaying notes

Database tables:
 - notes
  - no - INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT
  - title - VARCHAR(255) - Make this larger?
  - contents - TEXT
  - created - time of creation - some sort of timestamp
  - edited - time last edited - some sort of timestamp
  - parent - INTEGER - ID of the parent note, if any
 - tagdata
  - no - INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT
  - name - VARCHAR(255)
  # - desc - TEXT - an (optional) user-defined description?
 - taggings - The two fields should together form an unduplicatable key or
   something like that.
  - note - INTEGER - number of the item being tagged
  - tag - INTEGER - number of the tag assigned
 - Remove the underscore in 'AUTO_INCREMENT' when using SQLite3 instead of
   MySQL (look into this more)
